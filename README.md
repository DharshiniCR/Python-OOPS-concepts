# Python OOPS concepts
<p>
CLASS & OBJECTS
  
- collection of objects
- contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created
-	It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods
-	Classes are created by keyword class.
-	Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
-	Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: Myclass.Myattribute

INHERITANCE

-	capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. 
-	derived class or child class
-	base class or parent class
-	It represents real-world relationships well.
-	It provides the reusability of a code. 
-	allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
-	It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.

ENCAPSULATION

-	idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. 
-	This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. 
-	To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.
-	A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables, etc.

POLYMORPHISM

-	Many forms
-	same method name to be used for different types or classes
-	It can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading
